Paper 1 - Code for the analysis of Yerba Mate porous materials. Creation of a dataframe with the measured absoprtion curves and implementation of various analytical models and inverse methods to derive the macroscopical parameters. Finally, implementation of Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) approach to optimize multilayer absorbers (with different densities and granulometry)
